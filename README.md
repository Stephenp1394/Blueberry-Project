# Blueberry-Practice-Project
Please view the comments in the index file before reviewing this project. This project was built from scratch with Vanilla JS & pure CSS (no frameworks/libraries). The project may not appear to be that impressive in terms of the UI, but there is a very significant amount of JavaScript functionality under the hood that took a great deal of time and effort to implement. For example, please take a look at the functions I have on lines 431, 512, 220, and 67 in the main.js file.
